🌶️ Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string. 

🌶️ Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. 
If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the empty string. 
Sample String : 'w3resource'
Expected Result : 'w3ce'
Sample String : 'w3'
Expected Result : 'w3w3'
Sample String : ' w'
Expected Result : Empty String


🌶️ Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', 
except the first char itself. 
Sample String : 'restart'
Expected Result : 'resta$t'


🌶️ Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.
Sample String : 'abc', 'xyz'
Expected Result : 'xyc abz'


🌶️ Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3).
If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged. 
Sample String : 'abc'
Expected Result : 'abcing'
Sample String : 'string'
Expected Result : 'stringly'

🌶️🌶️🌶️Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.
A. Using range()
B. Not using range
C. Using the slice ([]) operator
D. Using while loop
E. Using reverse function with join

🌶️ You need to create an if statement to send accurate alerts to passengers. 
`boarding_call="Good Evening, this is the final call to AL passengers for the flight AL 466 which is planned to take off at 8.40A.M."`
    1. Oh no! Replace Good Evening with Good Morning in the below boarding call string. You would use two string functions. 
    2.  Check if the string has “AL”. If so, then print "Welcome to Air Lines." in the consol. You would use one string functions. 
    3.  Check if the string says AM or PM. If AM print “Passengers are requested to have their breakfast.”

🌶️ Write a Python program to change a given string to a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged. 


🌶️ Write a Python program to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string.


🌶️ Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence


🌶️ Write a Python script that takes input from the user and displays that input back in upper and lower cases.


🌶️ Write a Python function to reverses a string if it's length is a multiple of 4.


🌶️ Write a Python function to create the HTML string with tags around the word(s). 
Sample function and result :
add_tags('i', 'Python') -> '<i>Python</i>'
add_tags('b', 'Python Tutorial') -> '<b>Python Tutorial </b>'
